# Compbuilder
This is the project that served as my introduction to Python, created in 2022/2023. Over 30 hours were spent designing and coding the app. 

The app functions as a music notation software with playback as well as a digital piano (but unlike previous models found online, prioritizes replicability to a physical piano rather than range, in order to emulate playing on an actual piano).

View code in Compbuilder.py (main) and keyCommands.py

App functions without known errors but would like to revisit sometime in the future, now having actual formal education in Python/DSA to shorten code length + optimize time complexity.
Project set aside at the moment.

App files unfortunately too large to include in Github, download at https://www.mediafire.com/file/ho6bhdjexg43mvl/CompBuilder.zip/file . App is run by unzipping and opening CompBuilder.exe
